{"id":"vue3-layerboard-2a7","title":"Fix layers showing Error when toggled","description":"Some layers show 'Error' when toggled on, likely due to CORS or server unavailability. Consider adding proxy for CORS-blocked services.","notes":"## Research Findings (2026-01-29)\n\n**Error flow:** MapPanel.vue → fetchFeaturesInBounds() fails → emits layer-error → Layerboard.vue stores in layerErrors → UI shows \"Error\" in red\n\n**Error sources:**\n- HTTP failures (403, 500, 429, etc.)\n- Network timeouts\n- DNS resolution failures\n- CORS issues (separate from csi bug)\n\n**Weak patterns identified:**\n- No retry logic after failures\n- No timeout handling for slow servers\n- Errors persist when layer is toggled off (stale errors not cleared)\n- Generic error messages don't distinguish failure types\n- No fallback/recovery mechanisms\n\n**Recommended fixes:**\n1. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures (503, 429, timeouts)\n2. Add timeout parameter to fetch calls\n3. Clear errors when layer is toggled off\n4. Improve error messages to distinguish CORS vs HTTP vs timeout\n5. Add optional \"retry\" button for failed layers\n6. Consider caching successfully loaded data per session\n\n**Relationship to csi:** Some errors may be CORS-related (tracked separately in vue3-layerboard-csi). This bug focuses on general error handling improvements.\n## Closed (2026-01-29)\n\n**Speculative issue.** This bead was created assuming CORS console errors would cause visible \"Error\" states in the UI. After investigation:\n\n1. The CORS errors are pre-existing (same in production legacy app)\n2. They don't affect functionality - just console noise\n3. No actual \"Error\" display has been observed in the layer UI\n\nThe error handling infrastructure exists and works correctly. If actual layer errors are observed in the future, a new bead can be created with specific reproduction steps.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"rothwell.andy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-28T10:23:54.6277867-05:00","created_by":"rothwell.andy@gmail.com","updated_at":"2026-01-29T14:00:44.3575441-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T14:00:44.3575441-05:00"}

{"id":"vue3-layerboard-vee","title":"PlowPHL layers get fuzzy when zooming in - missing scale-based layer switching","description":"## Problem\nIn the streetsmartphl example, PlowPHL layers (Treated Street Status, etc.) look correct when zoomed out, but when zooming in the layer becomes fuzzy/pixelated. The graphics don't re-render at higher resolution - they just scale up the low-zoom tiles.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe vue3-layerboard implementation only uses tiled MapServer endpoints at all zoom levels. The legacy StreetSmartPHL app has a two-layer approach that switches between:\n- **zoomOut** (`tiled: true`): MapServer `/tile/` endpoint - fast, pre-cached tiles\n- **zoomIn** (`tiled: false`): Dynamic WebMap layers fetched from ArcGIS with full resolution\n\nThe legacy app gets `minScale`/`maxScale` from the ArcGIS REST API for each layer, watches the current map scale, and automatically swaps between the tiled and dynamic versions based on zoom level.\n\n## Affected Layers\nAll PlowPHL tiled layers in `examples/streetsmartphl/src/App.vue` (lines 193-224):\n- plowTreatedStreetsStatus\n- plowNotTreatedStreets  \n- plowConditional\n- plowHighways\n\nURLs: `https://streetsgis.phila.gov/arcgis/rest/services/PlowPHL/{service}/MapServer`\n\n## Fix Required\nImplement the same two-layer approach with scale-based switching that the legacy app has:\n\n1. For each PlowPHL layer, define two versions:\n   - zoomOut: current tiled MapServer approach\n   - zoomIn: dynamic WebMap layer (need to find/add these to a WebMap or use /export/ endpoint)\n\n2. Fetch layer definitions with minScale/maxScale from ArcGIS REST API\n\n3. Watch map scale changes and toggle between the two layer versions based on the scale thresholds\n\n## Reference\nLegacy implementation in StreetSmartPHL:\n- `src/topics/plow.js` - topic-tiled-layers config with zoomIn/zoomOut pairs\n- `src/components/TopicTiledLayers.vue` - handles the switching logic\n- `src/components/Checkbox.vue` - shouldBeDisabled() checks minScale/maxScale\n\n## Testing Notes\nRequires an active snow event to test. May need to mock the storms API response to simulate a deployment.","notes":"**Mock in place for testing:** Line 530 in `examples/streetsmartphl/src/App.vue` has been changed to default to 'Full Deployment' when no storm data exists. This allows testing PlowPHL layers without an active snow event. Revert this line before committing any fix:\n```typescript\n// Current (mocked):\nreturn stormsData?.Deployment || 'Full Deployment'  // MOCK: remove before committing\n\n// Original:\nreturn stormsData?.Deployment || ''\n```\n## Implementation Complete (2026-01-29)\n\nScale-based layer switching implemented on branch `wip/plowphl-zoom-fix`:\n- Layers with `scaleBasedRendering: true` fetch MapServer metadata for scale thresholds\n- Zoomed out: uses /tile/ endpoint (fast, cached)\n- Zoomed in: uses /export/ endpoint (dynamic, sharp)\n\n**Testing limitation:** Can't fully verify without active snow event. Export requests return 200 OK but images are empty (no current data on server). Mock removed - awaiting next snow event to verify.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"rothwell.andy@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T12:57:20.0734585-05:00","created_by":"rothwell.andy@gmail.com","updated_at":"2026-01-29T14:02:39.6851907-05:00"}
